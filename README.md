# NNU Networks Course Pinger
For the Networks course at NNU, we we're assigned with the project of creating a pinger. 
In this project, I adapted Python code from our Networks textbook for an ICMP pinger and added onto the code in order to get the pinger working correctly. 
This project required some knowledge of the Python programming language and an understanding of the ICMP network protocol to get the pinger to ping hosts.
