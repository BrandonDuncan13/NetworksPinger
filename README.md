# NNU Networks Course Pinger
For the Networks course at NNU, we were assigned the project of creating a pinger. 
In this project, I adapted Python code from our Networks textbook for an ICMP pinger, adding onto the existing code in order to get the pinger working correctly. 
This project required some knowledge of the Python programming language and an understanding of the ICMP network protocol to ping hosts.
